# Cat vs. Dog Classification using SVM üê±üê∂

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs. Using image data, the model identifies whether the input belongs to a cat or a dog. 



## What it is

A **Jupyter Notebook** demonstrating how SVM can be applied to solve a binary classification problem using image data. This project is designed as an introductory exercise in machine learning for image classification.
