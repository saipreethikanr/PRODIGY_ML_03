# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation ðŸŽ¯

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for a classification task using Python. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.



## What it is

A **Jupyter Notebook** that explores the application of the SVM algorithm in machine learning for classification problems. This project is aimed at understanding how SVM can separate data points into distinct classes with the use of hyperplanes.
